	- Copyright AlexandreUser.
# Objective:
		The idea of the game is making a RPG top-down look, using the power of python 3, 
	the history is simple and open, like a sandbox game, you can level up your character by killing monsters or making quests. During this time the amount of experience can also be divided betwen all players on your party or guild.
		In the near future we hope we can make a skin system inside the game, but with python 3 syntax, that would be pretty hard.
